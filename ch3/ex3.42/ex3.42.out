 | Exercise 3.42:
 | 
 | Ben Bitdiddle suggests that it's a waste of time to create a new serialized
 | procedure in response to every withdraw and deposit message. He says that
 | make-account could be changed so that the calls to protected are done outside
 | the dispatch procedure. That is, an account would return the same serialized
 | procedure (which was created at the same time as the account) each time it is
 | asked for a withdrawal procedure.
 | 
 | (define (make-account balance)
 |   (define (withdraw amount)
 |     (if (>= balance amount)
 |         (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
 |                balance)
 |         "Insufficient funds"))
 |   (define (deposit amount)
 |     (set! balance (+ balance amount))
 |     balance)
 |   (let ((protected (make-serializer)))
 |     (let ((protected-withdraw (protected withdraw))
 |           (protected-deposit (protected deposit)))
 |       (define (dispatch m)
 |         (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) protected-withdraw)
 |               ((eq? m 'deposit) protected-deposit)
 |               ((eq? m 'balance) balance)
 |               (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"
 |                            m))))
 |       dispatch)))
 | 
 | Is this a safe change to make? In particular, is there any difference in what
 | concurrency is allowed by these two versions of make-account?

 | Answer:

 | This is a safe change to make. There is no difference in what concurrency is
