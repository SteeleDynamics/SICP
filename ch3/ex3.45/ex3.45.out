 | Exercise 3.45
 |
 | Louis Reasoner thinks our bank-account system is unnecessarily complex
 | and error-prone now that deposits and withdrawals aren't automatically
 | serialized. He suggests that make-account-and-serializer should have
 | exported the serializer (for use by such procedures as serialized-exchange)
 | in addition to (rather than instead of) using it to serialize accounts and
 | deposits as make-account did. He proposes to redefine accounts as follows:
 |
 | (define (make-account-and-serializer balance)
 |   (define (withdraw amount)
 |     (if (>= balance amount)
 |         (begin (set! balance (- balance amount))
 |                balance)
 |         "Insufficient funds"))
 |   (define (deposit amount)
 |     (set! balance (+ balance amount))
 |     balance)
 |   (let ((balance-serializer (make-serializer)))
 |     (define (dispatch m)
 |       (cond ((eq? m 'withdraw) (balance-serializer withdraw))
 |             ((eq? m 'deposit) (balance-serializer deposit))
 |             ((eq? m 'balance) balance)
 |             ((eq? m 'serializer) balance-serializer)
 |             (else (error "Unknown request -- MAKE-ACCOUNT"
 |                          m))))
 |     dispatch))
 |
 | Then deposits are handled as with the original make-account:
 |
 | (define (deposit account amount)
 |  ((account 'deposit) amount))
 |
 | Explain what is wrong with Louis's reasoning. In particular, consider what
 | happens when serialized-exchange is called.
 |
 |
 | Answer
 |
 | When a process calls 'serialized-exchange', it obtains the serializer for
 | 'to-account'. Afterwards, when that same process calls 'exchange', it tries
 | to obtain the serializer for 'to-account' again. As a result, the process
 | that called 'serialized-exchange' freezes.
