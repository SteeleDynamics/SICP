 | Exercise 4.2
 |
 | Louis Reasoner plans to reorder the 'cond' clauses in 'eval' so that the
 | clause for procedure applications appears before the clause for assignments.
 | He argues that this will make the interpreter more efficient: Since programs
 | usually contain more applications than assignments, definitions, and so on,
 | his modified 'eval' will usually check fewer clauses than the original
 | 'eval' before identifying the type of an expression.
 |
 | a. What is wrong with Louis's plan? (Hint: What will Louis's evaluator do
 | with the expression '(define x 3)'?)
 |
 | b. Louis is upset that his plan didn't work. He is willing to go to any
 | lengths to make his evaluator recognize procedure applications before it
 | checks for most other kinds of expressions. Help him by changing the syntax
 | of the evaluated language so that procedure applications start with 'call'.
 | For example, instead of '(factorial 3)' we will now have to write
 | 'call factorial 3)' and instead of '(+ 1 2)' we will have to write
 | '(call + 1 2)'.
 |
 | Answer
 |
 |   Part (a)
 |   
 |   The predicate procedure '(define (application? exp) (pair? exp))' only
 |   checks if the expression is a pair. This will match with all of the other
 |   following predicate expressions in the following clauses:
 |
 |   1. 'assignment?'
 |   2. 'definition?'
 |   3. 'if?'
 |   4. 'begin?'
 |   5. 'cond?'
 |
 |   If Louis Reasoner's 'eval' procedure with reordered clauses tries to
 |   evaluate the combination '(define x 3)', it will try to look up the
 |   procedure object value for 'define' in the current environment instead of
 |   mutating the current environment by adding a key-value pair. 'Define'
 |   will no longer be a reserved keyword and 'define'-ing variables and
 |   procedures will be broken. The same misapplication will happen to 'set!',
 |   'if', 'begin', and 'cond'.
 |
 |   Part (b)
 |
 |  (define (application? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'call)) 
 |  (define (operator exp) (cadr exp)) 
 |  (define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
